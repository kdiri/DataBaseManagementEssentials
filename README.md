# Database Management Essentials

The assignments that I've finished for the cours of [Database Management Essentials on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/database-management).


To have a MySQL on your localhost easily, you can install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and use it. 


## Launch MySQL as a docker instance: 
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml  up -d 
```

### Stop MySQL Instance
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml down
```
